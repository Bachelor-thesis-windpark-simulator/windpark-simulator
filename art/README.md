# Exporting car textures

Resizing car textures using Photoshop resulted in better results than using Adobe Illustrator.

The procedure used was:
- In Illustrator: Export car textures to PNG in 16x resolution using the "Assets Export" window
- In Photoshop: Resize the images to 6.25% size using the Automate > Batch... command
  - Options are:
    - Play
      - Set: Futurium
      - Action: Shrink Cars
    - Source: Folder (select the folder where the saved PNGs are)
    - Destination: Folder (select the destination folder)
      - File naming: 
        - Document name
        - Extension
