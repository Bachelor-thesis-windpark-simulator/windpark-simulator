# js Folder

In this folder are several subfolders:

- cars
- dashboard
- data-sources
- editor
- lib
- power-ups
- test
- other files ...

## cars

The code in this directory is related to showing cars on the roads of a MapView. It does not need to be touched for this project. Would be cool, if the other tile types would be as nice as this.

## dashboard

Most if this is not used in this project, since power up and the action elements are not longer used.
They are just a leftover from the future mobility parent project.

## data-sources

Here the main calculations will be done. The postfix \_OLD refers to an unused file from the parent project. This is caused by changes done in the original file but to keep the old file, too, it got the postfix.

File(s) with the postfix \_WT refer to files added for this project. WT stands for wind turbine. Currently only one file contains this postfix, that is the file for cacaulations with the data type wind turbine.

## Miscellaneous

Part that are commented out because they are part of the olf project and for this use case no longer required. We kept them in case something will be needed in the future.
