The png file is still missing and has to be designed. 
Currently there are two different states planned (see windturbines.json), which switch by rotating. 
This number might be increased. 
It would make sense to have at least 4 variants, one for two possible prevailing wind directions (NN/SS, EE/WW, NE/SW, ES/WN).
If the wind passes the wind turbine in prevailing wind direction possitively or negativly / forwards or backwards, does not matter for the representation.
